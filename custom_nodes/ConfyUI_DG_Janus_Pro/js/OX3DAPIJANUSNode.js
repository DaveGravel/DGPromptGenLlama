@description: This extension is for experimental purposes only. Although I am a proficient Pascal and C++ programmer, I am relatively new to Python and may have made mistakes in the code.
@description: I have created these nodes primarily for my personal use. Some parts of the code are adapted from existing custom nodes, while others are original and designed entirely by me.

# Hello, I’m Dave Gravel. By trade, I’m a C++ programmer specializing in 3D and Physics, 
# along with anything related to this field. I have a basic understanding of almost all 
# programming languages, but the two I’ve used the most and in which I excel are Pascal and C++. 
# I’m familiar with the logic of most other languages, though I haven’t worked with them extensively. 
# As a result, my code may include some repetitive logic and certain methods that could be better 
# implemented, but overall, everything should still work pretty well, hehe.

# A year ago, or maybe a little more, I had created a Llama 3.1 node. However, since it was difficult 
# to get it working due to the size of the Llama 3.1 8B model and because some tools for loading 
# the Llama model at the time conflicted with other tools in ComfyUI, I decided not to make it public.

# When Llama 3.2 was released, I tested the tools again, and the conflicts seem to be resolved now, 
# and Llama works very well. So, I decided to update my node, DGPromptGenLlama, and while building it, 
# I realized that some cool options could be added, like styles and a few other features I’ll discuss below.

# Since everything seems to be working well for me now, I decided to share it with the public. 
# This way, it might be useful for others as well. It’s a great tool if you’re running out of ideas 
# for writing your prompts.

# With this, you’ll be able to create amazing images and videos. Or you can simply use Llama like ChatGPT, 
# as it’s possible to configure and create your own agents for anything, not just for prompts.
