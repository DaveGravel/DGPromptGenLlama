# OX3DLlamaPromptGen
Hello, I’m Dave Gravel. By trade, I’m a C++ programmer specializing in 3D and Physics, along with anything related to this field. I have a basic understanding of almost all programming languages, but the two I’ve used the most and in which I excel are Pascal and C++. I’m familiar with the logic of most other languages, though I haven’t worked with them extensively. As a result, my code may include some repetitive logic and certain methods that could be better implemented, but overall, everything should still work pretty well, hehe.

A year ago, or maybe a little more, I had created a Llama 3.1 node. However, since it was difficult to get it working due to the size of the Llama 3.1 8B model and because some tools for loading the Llama model at the time conflicted with other tools in ComfyUI, I decided not to make it public.

When Llama 3.2 was released, I tested the tools again, and the conflicts seem to be resolved now, and Llama works very well. So, I decided to update my node, LlamaPromptGen, and while building it, I realized that some cool options could be added, like styles and a few other features I’ll discuss below.

Since everything seems to be working well for me now, I decided to share it with the public. This way, it might be useful for others as well. It’s a great tool if you’re running out of ideas for writing your prompts.

With this, you’ll be able to create amazing images and videos. Or you can simply use Llama like ChatGPT, as it’s possible to configure and create your own agents for anything, not just for prompts.
